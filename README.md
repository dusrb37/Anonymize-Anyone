This project is built on top of [LDM](https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion). We trained on data provided by [CelebA-HQ](https://github.com/tkarras/progressive_growing_of_gans), [CelebA-Dialog](https://github.com/ziqihuangg/CelebA-Dialog), [CelebAMask-HQ](https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA/CelebAMask_HQ.html), and [MM-CelebA-HQ-Dataset](https://github.com/IIGROUP/MM-CelebA-HQ-Dataset). We also make use of the [Imagic implementation](https://github.com/justinpinkney/stable-diffusion/blob/main/notebooks/imagic.ipynb).
