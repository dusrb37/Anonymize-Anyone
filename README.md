## :hammer: Train

### 1. Train for the inpainting model
#### **Training with Focused Feature Enhancement Loss & Difference Loss**

**'Focused Feature Enhancement Loss'** is used to effectively learn detailed areas. **'Difference Loss'** enables the model to distinguish between the two classes (e.g. Asians and Caucasians) and preserve their respective. For difference loss, we first generate images using the model with a difference prompt and then use those during training along with our data. Refer to the paper to learn more about it.

___Note: It needs at least 24GB VRAM.___


```bash
export MODEL_NAME="stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-inpainting"
export INSTANCE_DIR="path-to-instance-images"
export DIFFERENCE_DIR="path-to-difference-images"
export OUTPUT_DIR="path-to-save-model"

accelerate launch train_anonymize_inpaint.py \
  --pretrained_model_name_or_path=$MODEL_NAME  \
  --train_text_encoder \
  --instance_data_dir=$INSTANCE_DIR \
  --difference_data_dir=$DIFFERENCE_DIR \
  --output_dir=$OUTPUT_DIR \
  --ffel_weight=0.01 \
  --threshold=0.5 \
  --with_difference_loss \
  --instance_prompt="a photo of asian" \
  --difference_prompt="a photo of white man" \

  --train_batch_size=1 \
  --use_8bit_adam \
  --gradient_checkpointing \
  --learning_rate=1e-6 \
  --lr_scheduler="constant" \
  --lr_warmup_steps=0 \
  --num_difference_images=300 \
  --max_train_steps=10000 \
```

#### **Important Args**

##### **General**

- `--pretrained_model_name_or_path` what model to train/initalize from
- `--INSTANCE_DIR` path for dataset that you want to train
- `--DIFFERENCE_DIR` path-for difference images
- `--output_dir` where to save/log to
- `--instance_prompt` prompt that you want to train
- `--train_text_encoder` Fine-tuning `text_encoder` with `unet` can give much better results, especially for faces

##### **Loss**

- `--ffel_weight` Focused Feature Enhancement Loss
- `--threshold` Parameter for critical feature mask, It is recommended to experiment by adjusting it up or down from 0.5
- `--with_difference_loss` Difference Loss
- `--difference_prompt` prompt that you want to preserve
- `--num_difference_images` Number of generating images for difference prompt, 200-300 worked well for our cases


### 2. Train for DPO

Run the shell script below for training DPO. 
Please refer to the original [code base repository](https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/DiffusionDPO) and change the settings accordingly. We used [pre-trained model](https://huggingface.co/radames/sd-21-DPO-LoRA).
```bash
./tarin_dpo_diffusion.sh
```

## :hammer: Inference

To inference your dataset, change the path of the image and mask.
```bash
python inference.py
```
